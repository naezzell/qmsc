******** basic repo set up/ work flow guide ********

1. git clone git@github.com:naezzell/qmsc.git
--> if you don't have ssh keys set up with github: https://help.github.com/en/enterprise/2.15/user/articles/adding-a-new-ssh-key-to-your-github-account

** This will create a directory called qmsc. I recommend renaming it to your desired feature name, i.e. qmsc-ibmsim if working on ibm simulator

2.) git checkout main
** this loads you on main branch--likely not necessary, but just pedagogic here

3. $ git checkout -b myfeature dev
** this creates a local branch called myfeature which forks off of main

4. conda create -n qmsc
** creates a conda environment called qmsc

5. conda activate qmsc
** activates qmsc environment

--> now make sure you are in qmsc directory with setup.py file

6. pip install -e .
** this builds the qmsc package to your conda env while installing necessary dependencies like qiskit along the way
** building the package let's commands like:
   from qmsc import ibmsim
work from any directory so as long as your conda env is active

7. make code changes
** DO NOT make changes to same files at once. This causes merge conflicts. That's why we have feature branches... only work on feature that branch is related to.

8. git commit
** as you add features to myfeature, commit them and add comments regularly

-->Once you're satisfied with your feature, you can merge it to dev

9. git checkout dev
** puts you back on local copy of dev branch which is hosted remotely

10. git fetch origin dev
** this fetches any changes pushed to dev by other users (i.e. updates your local dev with remote changes)

11. git merge --no-ff myfeature
** merges changes on 'myfeature' branch to 'dev' branch locally
** btw, no-ff flag causes merge to always make new commit object which prevents loss of historical info about feature branch

--> after you are done with features, you want to delete local branch before pushing merged features to remote
--> this makes cleaner commit log history
12. git branch -d myfeature

13. git push origin dev
** this pushes altered features to remote
